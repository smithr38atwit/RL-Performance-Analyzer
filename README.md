## Back-end setup
Setup virtual python environment: ```python -m venv .venv```  
Install required packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
To update requirements.txt if you add a new package: ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```  
### Setup your Ballchasing API token
1. Go to [ballchasing](https://ballchasing.com/upload) and sign in with steam
2. Generate an upload token
3. Create a file in your main folder called ".env" and add your token to it with format ```TOKEN={yourToken}```  
  
***Do not commit .venv or .env to github***
  
  
To run the FastAPI server, just run "main.py"
## Front-end setup (until the React project is made)
The only setup required is running ```npm start``` in powershell, which will ensure script.js is updated every time script.ts is changed.
The JS file is automatically generated by the typescript compiler, so all changes should be made to script.ts.
  
If you don't already have it, get the Live Server extension to host the front-end.
  
  
Another useful extension you might want for testing is Thunder Client, which lets you save and send HTTP requests and easily view the results.
